# Traffic Sign Object Detection with YOLOv5

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a YOLOv5 model for traffic sign object detection. The YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm is a real-time object detection system, and the v5 version is known for its efficiency and accuracy.

The primary goal of this project is to detect and classify traffic signs in images or video frames, with a focus on real-time performance.

## YOLOv5 Model

The YOLOv5 model is used for its speed and accuracy in object detection tasks. You can find the official YOLOv5 repository [here](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5).

## Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset containing images with annotated traffic signs. Make sure to use a diverse dataset that covers various scenarios and types of traffic signs.

## Model Training

To train the YOLOv5 model on your custom dataset, follow the instructions provided in the [YOLOv5 repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5).

## Model Evaluation

Evaluate the trained model on your test dataset using the evaluation script provided in the YOLOv5 repository.

```bash
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node 4 --use_env val.py --data your_data.yaml --img-size 640
```

## Android Application Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio installed
- Android device or emulator

### Deployment Steps

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
    https://github.com/shivanagendrak/ObjectDetection_TrafficSigns
   ```

2. Open the Android Studio project located in the `android_app` directory.

3. Configure the necessary dependencies in the `build.gradle` file.

4. Build and run the Android application on your device or emulator.

## Usage

Once the Android application is deployed, you can use the camera functionality to capture images or videos containing traffic signs. The YOLOv5 model will perform real-time object detection, marking and classifying traffic signs in the captured content.

Feel free to customize and extend the project according to your specific requirements!

Remember to replace placeholders such as `your_data.yaml`, `yourusername`, and adjust the paths or instructions based on your actual project structure. Additionally, provide any specific instructions or configurations required for running the Android application.
